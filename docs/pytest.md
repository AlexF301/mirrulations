## Checking Test Coverage

### To check the test coverage of your code using Pytest, follow these steps:

* Open a terminal or file explorer window and navigate to your project directory.
* Find the htmlcov folder and open it.
* Inside the htmlcov folder, locate the index.html file and open it.

#### The index.html file will display the test coverage report, showing you which lines of code were executed during the test run and which were not.
